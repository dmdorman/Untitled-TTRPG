Untitled TTTRPG (UnT)

In UnT the player controls multiple characters. Theses characters share a pool of Health (HP) and Actions (AP). In the event of a character death the player will be allowd to 'replenish' their characters at the end of the current narrative arc.

Design Principles

UnT has a focus on the follow
- Controlling multiple characters
- Type interactions
- Customizable bodies (profiles)
- Customizable Abilities
- Small numbers
- Team based turns

Concepts

Exploding Dice - In UnT every roll can 'explode' this means if you roll the maximum on a particular die you can re-roll that die and add the result. An exploded roll and also explode.

Tokens - Good roleplay can be rewarded with 'tokens' either in the moment by the GM or at the end of the session by the players (one gifted token per player). Tokens can be cashed in later for narrative and in combat benefits.

Types - Characters and abilities have 'types'. Each type interactions with each other type differently. For example a type named 'fire' might caused double damage against a type called 'water'. These types are customizeable from campaign to campagin and so UnT doesn't come with any standard set of types.

Profiles - UnT makes very few assumptions about the bodies of the characters in play. However, because sectional armor and targeting is an import part of the rules each character has the following, unless specified otherwise by a perk, a weakpoint, a center of mass (CoM), and extremities. Each body part takes different amounts of damage if it.

Defense - In addition to Health characters also have defenses. This is is how much is subtracted from each incoming damage roll. Each time defense successfully subtracts damage it decreases in amount by 1.

Temporary Defense - Defense that will fade at 1 point per minute until 0.

Building Your Roster

The first thing to decide in UnT character creation is how many characters you will control. The GM may impose some minimum or maximum number of characters. 

Next decide how you want to divide your resources. When creating characters you have a few resources that are shared amongst all characters. Those are HP, AP, Perks, Skills, and Abilities.

HP - How much health your character has
AP - How many actions can you character take in a given combat round OR how many actions can your character make in a 5 second period
Perks - Character attributes that have a large effect on how a character is played
Skills - What your character is good at (the skills a character has access to is usually determined by the campagin)
Abilities - What can your character do? What an ability is includes attacks, defense, movment, and utility actions a character can make. Abilities are custom made for each character. 

How many resources you have will be determined by the campagin and will be the same for each player. As an example a campagin could have a resourse pool of 40 HP, 6 AP, 4 Perks, 8 Skills, and 10 Abilities. 

Next decide the profile of each character. To do this imagine what you want your character to be and determine what would be their weak point, CoM, and extremities. This includes how many of each there are. Choose the size of each character. The amount of sizes available to each charcter may vary from campaign to campgain, but the standard ones are tiny, small, medium, large, huge, and gigantic. Smaller sizes can a harder time being hit by larger sizes, but will take more damage.

Next decide your characters' typing. Choose one or two typings. 

Next decide your characters' abilities. Each ability is given a budget of 5 points with which to buy its' attributes. You may spend multiple abilities points for one ability to increase the budget, but for each ability point spend the AP cost of the ability goes up by one. Build your ability from the pre-defined attributes below or create a custom ability by negotiating a price with the GM. Custom abilities may not be supported in UnT's Foundry automation.

Disadvantes

        Massive (-4): 1d6+2 HP of damage

Next decide your charters' perks. 
    Hard to Hit (1): attacking characters have a -1 to their attack roll
    Accurate (1): character has +1 to hit on their attack roll
    Berserker (2): each time you end a turn next to an enemy +2 temporary defense per adjacent enemy (up to 6)
    Amorphous (1): hit zones do not affect this character
    No Weak Points (2): character does not have Weak Point hit zone

=========== Combat ===========
To make an attack a character must use an ability. To hit a target roll 1d10. The roll is modified by a few things such as positioning, relative size, and cover. 

For each 7 in the roll the the attacker gets to roll damage with type interactions only impacting the first damage roll.

Here are some examples:
    Users rolls a....
        6 - miss!
        7 - 1 hit
        13 - 1 hit
        14 - 2 hits (1 untyped)
        20 - 2 hits (1 untyped)
        21 - 3 hits (2 untyped)

Determine the hit zone! Roll a 1d10. 

Before type interactions subtract the defenders armor, size attribute, hit zone, and other factors that influence damage rolls. These are subtracted from every damage roll.
